												 The iconic Ayisa Tent design originates from the African architecture of the 13th century. The beautiful symmetry and clean lines 
												 of the Ayisa Tent is reminiscent of the great palaces of the African dynasties. The African dynasties themselves erected structures
												 similar to these in huge quantities to create vast tented camps, in celebration of royal weddings and special events.<br /><br />

                                                The Ayisa Tent's geometric shape and uniform design is also widely associated with Egyptian Art, an infinitely popular style 
												evocative of 1700 egyptian designes. With this perfect union of African design and East African engineering, Ayisa Tents are 
												the only African dynasties rememberances available to hire in Africa with South Sudan's engineered frames, and can withstand winds of up to 40mph.
